d3sy: A quick and dirty d3 playground with Node.js
==================================================

__d3sy__ is just a little sandbox for random experiments
with d3. Nothing super-special here, but maybe worth a
look if you're just getting started with the library and
want some code to jump off with.

Quickstart
----------

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ninjascribble/d3sy.git
$ cd d3sy
$ nmp install
$ node app
```

then browse to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

What is d3?
-----------

__d3__ is a JavaScript library that's often used for
data visualizations. It contains a model for creating
and updating documents through manipulation of the
underlying data, and a deep API for drawing and
animating SVG.
